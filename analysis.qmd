This file provides an overview of the AvianFlu package as well as some sample analyses.

The `AvianFlu` package contains descriptions of detections of Avian Flu as recorded by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service in 2022-2023.
This package may be of interest to anyone considered with poultry health.

```{r}
#| label: fig-myfigure
#| fig.cap: "XX MY CAPTION"
#| warning: false
#| fig.width: 6

  ggplot(aes(x = date_detected, color = woah_classification)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(x = "Date of detection", y = "Count",
       color = "WOAH classification")
```

We see in @fig-myfigure that XX add interpretation here XX.
